# FNPyScript

This Python script takes two paths to folders and compares file names inside them, then it writes result into an Excel file.

## Dependencies
- `os` - Python standard module
- `openpyxl` - Library

## Usage
1. Set the values for `folder_path1`, `folder_path2`, and `output_file` variables according to your requirements.
2. Ensure that the `openpyxl` library is installed (`pip install openpyxl` if not already installed).
3. Run the script.
4. The merged list of file names will be written to the specified Excel file.

Note: Ensure that the folders and files exist and the script has the necessary permissions to read from the folders and write to the output file.
